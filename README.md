Prework study guide for UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp
# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

What better way to study your class notes than on an interactive webpage with a friendly and professional cat? Mr. Tuxedo is here to help me study my coding bootcamp lessons with his reassuring demeanor and well-organized notes! This webpage will allow me to have a study guide to reference back to any time I need my notes. The webpage presents my notes in a clear and concise manner. Most importantly, creating this website taught me how to use the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I think Mr. Tuxedo would be proud.
